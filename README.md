### Hello there :wave:,

### My name is Lucas Girouard-Stranks, I go by the handle `lithiumtoast`

#### I'm a self-taught (who isn't?), passionate software developer from Canada :canada: 

#### I've started my dev journey at 11 years old with Visual Basic 6. Back then I realized I could build things with my mind like I was playing with lego. Later during university, I would learn that better than lego, these things I made can bring value to other people's lives.

#### Today I solve problems by building software solutions with my mind using an open-source developer platform (run time + libraries) called .NET with the C# programming language

#### Here's to thinking about an idea and making it a digitized reality! :tada:

#### I'm interested in applying my knowledge to address the social and economic development issues we face as a human collective. These include poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, gender equality, water, sanitation, energy, urbanization, environment, and social justice. :thought_balloon:

#### Always open to connecting with people, hearing about opportunities, and learning new ideas :bulb:
