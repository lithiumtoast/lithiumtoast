I've started my dev journey at 12 years old with Visual Basic 6 with an online open-source community called [Mirage Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JaByOWNcg) in 2005. This community was, one way or another, a [community of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) around indie game development. The community had a huge impact on my beliefs, values, and self-actualization. Back then I realized I could build structures with my mind like I was playing with lego. Later during university, I would learn that better than lego, these structures I made can bring value to other people's lives in countless ways.

Today, in my spare time I have a focus on C# and C for low-level systems (looking into Zig), primarily for video games. This includes using [native ahead-of-time compilation](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/form-factors.md#ahead-of-time-aot-compilation) for .NET to get native libraries and executables which are small, fast, and highly performant.

Today, I also follow the principles of [open-source way](https://www.theopensourceway.org) beyond just software. My GitHub account serves as the place where I share my ideas and solutions regarding my own personal entertainment, curisoity, and growth with the world. It's my hope that making my work free and public that you can find value in it as well.

In the grand scheme of things, I'm interested in applying my knowledge to address the social and economic development issues we face as a human collective. These include poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, gender equality, water, sanitation, energy, urbanization, environment, and social justice.
